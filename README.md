# Happy Hour Hero
The cocktail site for cocktail beginners.

## Description

Happy Hour Hero is a site for users who are interested in the world of cocktails but do not know where to start due to the sheer amount of varieties available. In this site, users can dip their toes by trying out a randomly generated cocktail on Happy Hour Hero where ingredients and instructions are provided. 

If the user enjoyed the cocktail, they could Favourite it and be able to revisit the cocktail recipe under the Favourites tab. If users change their mind about a drink added to Favourites, they would be able to remove it too. 

Furthermore, users would also be able to search up cocktails by name or ingredient and they would be able to pick from a list of cocktails relevant to their search. They would also be able to add cocktails to the Favourite list from the Search tab. However, once added to Favourites, users cannot favourite it a second time. 

Overtime, users end up with a list of cocktails of their liking!
